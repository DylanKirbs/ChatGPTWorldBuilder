# GPT World Builder

## Description

A `python` program that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 in order to complete the prompt.

## Installation

Download the files and make sure to obtain an API key from OpenAI's beta.

## Usage

Quite rudimentary at the moment. You have to edit the `createResponse(config, "")`, just add the `{feature}` you wish to describe in the text field. (I might add a GUI later and possibly integrations for DALL-E)

## Contributing

Nothing at the moments :(
